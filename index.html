        <h2>Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer</h2>
        <p>Hey! Shiba (Creator) here. This is short Tutorial/Info-thingy on how this works. Don't worry I've got you. btw if you go fullscreen (by pressing f11) I'll be happy.</p>
        <p>What is a pathfinding algorithm?
          At its core, a pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points that is from the <span style = "color:rgb(0, 155, 0)">Starting Node (Green)</span> to the <span style="color:red">Destination Node (Red).</span> Both of them can be dragged across anywhere in the grid. This application visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in action, and more!
        <p>All of the algorithms on this application are adapted for a 2D grid of 25x25 nodes, where 90 degree turns have a "cost" of 1 and movements from a node to another have a "cost" of 1. Alright Now you can see some button at the bottom with <ul><li>Dijkstra's Algorithm: the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path</li>
          <li>A* Search: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm. </li><li>Breath-first Search: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.</li><li> Depth-first Search: a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path</li></ul></p>
        <p>You can also make walls on the grid by just clicking and dragging your cursor, to give those algorithms some challenge as these Walls are impenetrable, meaning that a path cannot cross through them meaning that the algorithms would explore more paths, hence more exciting visualisation process.</p>
